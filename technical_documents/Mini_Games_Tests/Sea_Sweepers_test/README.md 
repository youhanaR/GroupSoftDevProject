# Sea Sweepers Testing Documentation

This folder contains my testing materials for the Sea Sweepers game project.

## What's in here

I've included:

- `test-plan.md` - My test cases for the game features
- `test-results.md` - Results from running the tests (found a few bugs!)
- `bug-tracker.md` - Bugs I found and how I fixed them
- `automated-tests/` - Some JavaScript tests I wrote to check game functions

## How I tested

I created test cases for the main game features and then ran through them manually. I also wrote some basic automated tests to check the game logic functions like collision detection and object creation.

I tested on:
- My laptop (Chrome & Firefox)
- My phone (though controls don't work well)
- Asked two friends to play and give feedback

The biggest issues I found were with image loading and mobile controls. Also noticed some performance issues on mobile when there are lots of marine animals with glowing effects.

## Running the tests

If you want to run the automated tests:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run `npm install` in the automated-tests folder
3. Run `npm test`

Note: I'm still learning Jest so some tests might need fixing. This is my first time writing automated tests!

## Game Testing Challenges

The hardest parts to test were:

1. The visual effects (glow effects, animations)
2. Performance on different devices
3. Image loading (depends on network and file availability)
4. Collision detection accuracy

I found the diagonal movement bug by accident when I realized the duck moved faster when using two arrow keys at once!
