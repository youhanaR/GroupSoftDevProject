Detailed Bug Reports
Bug #1: Diagonal Movement Speed
When pressing two arrow keys simultaneously, the duck moves approximately 1.4x faster than when moving in a cardinal direction. This is because the horizontal and vertical movements are applied independently without normalization.
Bug #2: Marine Animal Glow Effect Flickering
On lower-end devices, the marine animal glow effect causes flickering. This appears to be related to the pulsing effect created by adjusting global alpha in combination with the radial gradient.
Bug #3: Missing Image Files
Several image files appear to be missing or have incorrect paths:

milk.png
whale.png

Bug #4: Trash Spawning Too Close
When collecting trash, new trash sometimes spawns too close to the duck, making it too easy to collect multiple items in rapid succession.
Bug #5: No Mobile Controls
The game has no touch controls for mobile devices, making it unplayable on tablets and phones without a physical keyboard.
Bug #6: Collision Detection Edge Cases
Collision detection using bounding rectangles sometimes feels imprecise, especially with irregularly shaped marine animals.
Bug #7: Performance on Mobile
Frame rate drops significantly on mobile devices when multiple marine animals are on screen with glow effects active.
Recommendations

Fix diagonal movement by normalizing the movement vector when multiple arrow keys are pressed
Add mobile controls with on-screen buttons or touch/drag functionality
Fix image paths to ensure all images load correctly
Optimize glow effects for better performance on mobile
Improve collision detection to better match visual shapes
Add spawn protection to prevent trash from appearing too close to the duck
Add a pause function when tab loses focus
Add difficulty levels for better player experience

Conclusion
Sea Sweepers is a fun and visually appealing game with good core mechanics. The main issues are related to mobile compatibility, image loading, and some minor gameplay balance issues. With the recommended fixes, the game would provide a better experience across all platforms.
