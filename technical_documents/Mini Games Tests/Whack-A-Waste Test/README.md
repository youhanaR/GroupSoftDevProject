Whack-A-Waste Testing Documentation
This folder contains my testing materials for the Whack-A-Waste game project.
What's in here
I've included:

test-plan.md - My test cases for the game features
test-results.md - Results from running the tests (found some bugs!)
bug-tracker.md - Bugs I found and how I fixed them
automated-tests/ - Some JavaScript tests I wrote to check game functions

How I tested
I created test cases for the main game features and then ran through them manually. I also wrote some basic automated tests to check the game logic functions.
I tested on:

My laptop 
My phone


Still need to figure out how to fix that tab switching bug - it's annoying when the game keeps running after you switch tabs!
Running the tests
If you want to run the automated tests:

Make sure you have Node.js installed
Run npm install in the automated-tests folder
Run npm test
